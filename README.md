# Predicting-ICO-Outcomes
This project applies and evaluates a set of machine learning models to predict the outcome of an Initial Coin Offering

This project uses R to pre-process, fit, and evaluate the following machine learning models with optimized parameters:
1) C5.0 Decision Tree with Adaptive Boosting 
2) Random Forest 
3) Bagged Decision Tree
4) Nearest Neighbours
5) Support Vector Machine
6) Artificial Neural Network

Pre-processing involved the removal of outliers and imputation of missing values in addition to formatting the data according to each model's requirements. New relevant features where added and the optimal combination of them was selected using a feature selection algorith. 
Performance metrics of the different models were evaluated and the best model was selected at the end.
